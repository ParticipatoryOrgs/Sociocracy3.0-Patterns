title: "Describe Drivers"
---


**Describe drivers to understand, communicate and remember them.**

A simple way to describe a driver is with a statement containing: 

- a brief description of the situation (observation) 
- a description of what is needed (deficit) in relation to the situation 

When there’s disagreement about what is needed, it’s helpful to zoom out from specific solutions.


> Driver statement example: 

> _“The kitchen is a mess: there are no clean cups, the sink is full of dishes and it’s not possible to quickly grab a coffee and get right back to work. We need to figure out how we can keep the kitchen in a usable state.”_

The **driver statement** captures just enough information to communicate the need for an action or a decision. More information to reveal scope and details of the driver can be recorded in an appendix. 

A driver can be described as a problem or an opportunity, depending on the perspective of the person or the group.
