_A **backlog** (to-do-list) is a visible list of (often prioritized) uncompleted work items (drivers) that need to be addressed._

Types of backlog include:

-   operations backlog
-   sprint backlog
-   product backlog
-   impediments backlog



-   **Implementation**
    -   **analog backlog**: sticky notes on a wall, or index cards, magnets and whiteboard
    -   **digital backlog**: e.g. Google Sheets, Trello, Kanban Flow, Jira



Each item on a (prioritized) backlog contains:

-   a **short description** or a driver statement
-   a **unique reference number** (or link) for each work item
-   (the **order of work items**)
-   **dependencies** to other work items or projects
-   **due date** (if necessary)
-   (optional) a measure for **value** 
-   (optional) a measure for **investment** (often an estimate of time or complexity)
